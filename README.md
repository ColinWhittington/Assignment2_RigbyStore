# Assignment2_RigbyStore
Rigby Store is a C# GUI app that allows the user to navigate through a store database simulation. It begins with a home page, has a page to add sales information onto a text file, modify those sales, and then read those sales. The modify option, however, does not work at this time.

# Execution
To execute this app, open the profile solution file in visual studio, run the build and then compile it to execute it.

# Note
The UML and output are inside the .doc file.
